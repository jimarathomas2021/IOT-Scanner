		<h3>3.2.1 input Type color </h3>
			<p>
				The <b>color input type</b> (Fig. 3.1; lines 20&ndash;21) 
				enables the user to enter a color. Opera displays a 
				<i>color picker</i> control that shows the default color 
				(black) with a down arrow that, when clicked, shows 
				a drop-down with 20 basic colors (Fig. 3.2). The user 
				can select a color or click the Other... button to select 
				from additional basic colors or create a custom color. At 
				the time of this writing, most browsers render the color 
				input type as a text field in which the user can enter a 
				hexidecimal code.
