	<h1> About us.... </h1>
		<body><div> We are a group of students who are working on a project.
		We are going with the flow as we are learning coding and methods not previously
		covered in classes or classes we have not taken yet. Through the hard work and dedication
		we bring this project to you and hope you all enjoy it! :)
